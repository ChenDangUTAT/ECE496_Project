// the channel function is declared here 
// any sub function should only appear in the function channel 
// that is to say no function will appear outside 
// any subfunction should be tested outside the repository and should not be committed to the repository unless tested


// our current output should be nominated from one of follows 
// vector<double> channel(vector<bool>) which output snr 
// vector<pair<double,double>> channel(vector<bool>) which output priori probability
// additional input arguments may be input as we see fit
